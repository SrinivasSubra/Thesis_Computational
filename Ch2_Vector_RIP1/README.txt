Chapter 2: ITERATIVE ALGORITHMS FOR SPARSE RECOVERY FROM MEASUREMENT MATRICES SATISFYING AN l1 RESTRICTED ISOMETRY PROPERTY

Written by Srinivas Subramanian 

There are 5 experiments named Exp1, Exp2, .., Exp5
Run "Exp1.m" to run the first experiment, "Exp2.m" for the second and so on

For only the individual subexperiments, run the corresponding sections. 

Run the visualization sections directly, without having to run the actual experiments, to see the default saved experiment results 

Type "help MHTP", "help NHTP", "help l1approxprog", "help BasisPursuitcvx" or "help BasisPursuitLP" in the MATLAB Command Window to get a MATLAB function style description about the usage of the functions used for these experiments
