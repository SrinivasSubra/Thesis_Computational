Run "reproducible.m" to run all the experiments. 

For only the individual experiments, run the corresponding sections. 

Run the visualization sections directly, without having to run the actual experiments, to see the default saved experiment results 

Type "help MIHT", "help NIHT", "help mls" or "help NNM" in the MATLAB Command Window to get a MATLAB function style description about the usage of the functions used for these experiments
