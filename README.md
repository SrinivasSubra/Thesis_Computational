# Thesis_Computational
This repository contains the algorithm implementations and computational experiments performed in Chapters 2 and 3 of the thesis "Iterative algorithms for sparse and low-rank recovery from atypical measurements" by Srinivas Subramanian. The experiments in Chapter 4 can be found at https://github.com/SrinivasSubra/GETS (which are the same as the experiments performed in the article "A genomic tree based sparse solver"). 
The results of these numerical experiments are discussed at the end of each chapter of the thesis. 
A copy of the thesis may be available upon request (email: srini2092@tamu.edu).
