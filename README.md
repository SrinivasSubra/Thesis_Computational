# Thesis_Computational
This repository contains the algorithm implementations and computational experiments performed in the thesis "Iterative algorithms for sparse and low-rank recovery from atypical measurements" by Srinivas Subramanian. 
The results of these numerical experiments are discussed at the end of each chapter of the thesis.
